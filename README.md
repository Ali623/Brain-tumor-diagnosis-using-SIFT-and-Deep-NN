# Brain Tumor Diagnosis using SIFT and Deep Neural Networks

## Overview

This repository contains code for a brain tumor diagnosis system that leverages the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm for feature extraction from brain MRI images and a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for tumor classification. The system includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation components.

## Requirements

Before using the code in this repository, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- TensorFlow
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install most of these libraries using pip.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ali623/Brain-tumor-diagnosis-using-SIFT-and-Deep-NN.git

## Results
The system provides an effective way to diagnose brain tumors from MRI images. The SIFT algorithm extracts key features, and the DNN classifies tumors into different categories. The system includes performance visualizations and metrics to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
